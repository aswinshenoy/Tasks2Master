# Web Scraping using Python
Web scraping is the process of extracting information from a website (a form of data mining). A web scraper essentially acts as an API 
(Application Programming Interface), and is especially employed to pull data from websites which do not provide dedicated APIs.

The practice of Web scraping is a matter of controversy because the terms of use for many of the websites 
do not allow certain kinds of data mining. 

## Process of Web Scraping
1. **ACCESSING** - A web scraping script may access the web directly using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), or through a web browser. 
2. **FETCHING** - The script fetches (or downloads) the webpage
3. **PARSING** - The fetched webpage (which is usually in the form of HTML/XHTML) is parsed to obtain a structural, and searchable data. 
4. **SEARCHING** - This data is then used for searching the required information, usually by using syntax of the markup language (like tag/id/class names in case of html)
5. **REFORMATTING** - On finding the requried information, it is then stored and used in the desired form.
